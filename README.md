# Scuttle - A Multi-Objective MaxSAT Solver in Rust

Scuttle is a multi-objective MaxSAT solver written in Rust and based on the
[RustSAT](https://github.com/chrjabs/rustsat) library and the
[CaDiCaL](https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical) SAT solver.

## Publications

This solver was used in the following publications.
For each publication, a tag (specified in brackets) marks the exact revision used:
- CP'23 (`cp23`): "Preprocessing in SAT-Based Multi-Objective Combinatorial
  Optimization" \[5\]. Additional material
  [here](https://bitbucket.org/coreo-group/mo-prepro).
- CPAIOR'24 (`cpaior24`): "Core Boosting in SAT-Based Multi-Objective
  Optimization" \[6\]. Additional material in `cpaior24/`.
- TACAS'25 (`tacas25`): "Certifying Pareto-Optimality in Multi-Objective
  Maximum Satisfiability" \[7\]. Additional material in `tacas25/`.

## Algorithms

| First argument   | Description                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `p-minimal`      | P-Minimal model enumeration as described in \[1\] and \[2\]               |
| `lower-bounding` | Lower-bounding search as described in \[3\] (called "core-guiding" there) |
| `bioptsat`       | Sat-Unsat variant of the BiOptSat algorithm described in \[4\]            |

## Building

**Note**: Scuttle requires nightly Rust, which can be installed via `rustup`.

If you simply want a binary of the solver, you can install it from
[crates.io](https://crates.io) by running `cargo +nightly install --locked scuttle`.

To build the project from source, make sure to initialize the git submodules
with `git submodule update --init --recursive`. You can then build `scuttle` by
running `cargo +nightly build`.

By default, MaxPre preprocessing is not included in the build anymore. To
include preprocessing with MaxPre, add `--features=maxpre`.

### Features

- `sol-tightening`: includes heuristic tightening of solutions after they are found in the build
- `maxpre`: includes preprocessing with MaxPre in the build

## What's The Name

[Apparently](https://crabbingzone.com/what-is-group-of-crabs-called/) "scuttle"
is one of multiple term for a group of crabs, which seemed fitting for a
_multi_-objective solver in _Rust_.
